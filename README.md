### 🤖 AI-Assisted Mode

**Smarter, More Adaptive Sessions**

When enabled, the AI layer can perform context-aware interactions that adjust to dynamic page structures, supporting more adaptive navigation.

🎯 **Dynamic actions**  
AI can attempt to scroll, click, type, and submit simple forms — even when layouts shift or elements load late.

🧠 **Context awareness**  
Use model hints to follow flexible flows (e.g., SERP → listing → site).

🔗 **Compatible stack**  
Works alongside Multilogin profiles, proxies, and your scheduling rules.

#### 🔍 What it can attempt
- Scroll, click, and type through basic flows and simple forms
- Respond to unexpected elements, iframes, or dynamic layouts (best-effort)
- Follow flexible task logic (e.g., open listing, view info, follow website link)

#### ⚙️ Compatibility & setup
- Desktop and mobile user agents supported
- Works with campaigns & scripting features
- Bring your own AI key (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o) or run without the AI layer

### Capabilities and Modules

#### Search behavior
- Opens real browsers, types your keyword, scrolls, finds configured results, and clicks through like a typical user.
- Supports major engines: Amazon. Additional platforms by request.

#### Network & identity
- Proxy support: HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5. Pair with Multilogin profiles for device/browser variance.
- VPNs and configurable user agents supported.
- Desktop & mobile layout emulation available

#### Campaigns & scripting
- Independent campaigns you can start, pause, and schedule without impacting others.
- Optional "scripting" steps: warm up pages, perform related searches, then run your main journey.
- Fine-grained controls: dwell windows, scroll ranges, click order, and per-session randomness.

#### Analytics & reporting
- Session logs, CSV exports, and downloadable proof reports.
- Runs in real browsers; analytics tools may record sessions depending on filters and setup.

#### AI-assisted interaction
- Enable optional AI mode to guide scroll, click, type, and simple form steps on dynamic pages.
- Works with desktop and mobile layouts while keeping behavior that automates ad-page interactions.
- Uses AI models to analyze page structure and decide where to scroll, click, or type, adapting to different layouts.

## Before you proceed

### Two questions we get all the time

**I want to send 1000 clicks on my target — can each click come from a unique device?**

Yes. Each browser session runs as a separate Multilogin profile with its own fingerprint, user agent, and (with rotating proxies) its own IP. So 1000 clicks = 1000 distinct devices from the platform's perspective. You're not recycling one browser — you're scaling unique identities. Run 50+ profiles in parallel; each one is a fresh device. That's how operators hit volume without tripping duplicate-traffic flags.

**How can I know that the clicks are not detected as bots?**

Because the bot is built to look human. Randomized timing, scrolls, dwell time, and behavior patterns. Multilogin gives each session a unique fingerprint (canvas, WebGL, fonts) so no two sessions look alike. Add proxy rotation and configurable wait times — your traffic blends in with organic users. From a technical standpoint, this is as close to "real user" as automated traffic gets. Operators run volume every day; the tool is designed so clicks don't scream bot.

### Professional PPC Automation — Optimize Your Campaigns

Manual PPC management is inefficient. Humans get detected, inconsistent, and can't scale.

Our managed service exists for one reason: Execute professional PPC automation campaigns that optimize your Amazon PPC budgets while maintaining high performance.

If you're looking for "ethical marketing" or "safe PPC strategies," this isn't it. This is for operators who want to optimize campaigns and dominate their niche.

#### ✗ Doing It By Hand
- Constant human involvement
- Inconsistent timing and behavior
- Limited by time and attention
- Difficult to reproduce results
- Requires multiple tools stitched together

#### ✓ With Amazon Ads Clicker
- Fully automated browser sessions
- Repeatable, configurable behavior
- Runs while you're offline
- Scales with your machine, not your time
- One system handling execution end-to-end

Automation doesn't replace thinking — it replaces repetition.

### Why PPC Professionals Use This
- Target specific Amazon PPC campaigns
- Maximize ad interactions and performance
- 100+ parallel sessions for maximum volume
- Advanced automation techniques
- Optimize your ad spend for better results

This is not about marketing. It's about optimization.

### Designed for PPC Professionals

This isn't "white hat marketing" or "growth hacking."
- Amazon sellers wanting competitive advantage
- PPC managers optimizing campaign performance
- Automation specialists seeking efficiency
- Businesses that play to win, not follow rules

If you understand that competition means optimization, you're our client.

### What You Get
- **Desktop automation**: Runs locally
- **Real browser execution**: Actual browser sessions
- **Campaign-based configuration**: Organize by campaign
- **Parallel session control**: Run multiple sessions
- **Logging and exports**: Review and analyze
- **No cloud dependency**: You own the runtime

You own the runtime. Scale unlimited. No one can shut it down.

### Straight Talk
✗ This tool will not think for you.  
✗ It will not guarantee results.  
✓ It will execute exactly what you configure — at massive scale. That's the edge.

That's the point.

### Why Users Stick With It
- One-time setup, unlimited execution
- Configure once, run at scale forever
- No SaaS lock-in
- You own the software
- No shared infrastructure
- Runs on your machine
- No artificial limits
- Scale unlimited — 50+ sessions, your hardware
- Built by the automation expert
- Not a marketing team — real dev, real support

Used by Operators: Independent marketers and small agencies running volume and conversion

Most users start monthly. Serious users don't stay there long.
